| Guiding Principles | Types of changes | Versioning |
|---|---|---|
| Changelogs are for *humans*, not machines.<br>There should be an entry for every single version.<br>The same types of changes should be grouped.<br>Versions and sections should be linkable.<br>The latest version comes first.<br>The release date of each version is displayed. | `Added` for new features.<br>`Changed` for changes in existing functionality.<br>`Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.<br>`Removed` for now removed features.<br>`Fixed` for any bug fixes.<br>`Security` in case of vulnerabilities. | Teams are to decide what <br> MAJOR, MINOR and PATCH <br> versions are in their individual <br> repos based on the reach of their changes |
